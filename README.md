  Introduction
This set of data is about bank customers and whether or not they have closed their accounts. The dataset has information about 10,000 customers' demographics, accounts, and transactions. The goal of this analysis is to look at the data, figure out what might make a customer decide to close their account, and build a model that can predict whether a customer will close their account or not.


Â dataset description
There are 14 columns in the dataset:

RowNumber is the row's index.
CustomerId: Each customer's unique ID number.
Last name: The last name of the customer.

Data Analysis Steps
Load the dataset and look at what it has to offer.
Look for missing values and outliers.
Show how each variable is distributed.
Find statistics that describe each variable.
Using correlation analysis, you can find out how different things are related to each other.
Make visualizations of the data to find patterns and trends.
Use algorithms for machine learning to build a model that can make predictions.
Use the right metrics to judge how well the model works.
Read the results and figure out what they mean.

Conclusion
This data set tells us important things about bank customers and how they act. By looking at the data and building a predictive model, banks can figure out what causes customers to leave and take steps to keep them.
